1.3.0

Port to 1.20.1!

1.3.1

fixed stackoverflow bug

1.3.2

should fix requiring op for teleportation

1.3.3

should prevent conflicts with mods like apostesis that also use datapack folders like "affixes" by prefixing all my datapack jsons with modid in the folder path

1.3.4

added experimental support to allowing datapacks to ONLY edit fields in jsons they want to edit, allowing you to for example only change a rune's droprate, that way if stats for example change in a MNS update, you won't have to replace the json.
